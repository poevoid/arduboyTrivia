# FrankenMacCharDeeDen Level 1: MIND
is an *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia* themed 2player trivia game for the arduboy
left button is player one 
b button is player two
15 quesions, players have a chance to hit their button when they see the question, whoever presses the button first gets to answer! Be quick though, if you run out of time before you answer, you won't gain any points!
If neither player presses their button in time when a question is first shown, they will both lose a point.
Whoever has the most points by the end wins! :)
